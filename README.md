# ML-Income-Classifier-Using-UCI-Adult-Data-Set.

## Overview
This project implements various machine learning algorithms to classify whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 using the UCI Adult dataset. The analysis is part of ECON 418 (Econometrics) coursework at the University of Arizona.

Key machine learning algorithms applied:
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Random Forest

The analysis includes data cleaning, model training, evaluation, and comparison to determine the best-performing model.

## Dataset
The dataset, sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult), contains demographic and employment-related information. The target variable is **income**, classified as:
- `0`: Income â‰¤ $50,000
- `1`: Income > $50,000
